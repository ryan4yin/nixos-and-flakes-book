# Installation

Nix can be installed in various ways:

1. As a package manager on macOS, Linux, or WSL.
2. As the system environment manager on NixOS, a Linux distribution that utilizes Nix for
   system management.

This book primarily focuses on the usage of NixOS and Flakes. Therefore, we will skip
content that pertains solely to Nix(such as installation on macOS, Linux, or WSL).

The installation process of NixOS is straightforward, but we won't delve into the
specifics here. For more information, please visit the official download site at
<https://nixos.org/download.html>.

> may be a good starting point for you, you can learn how to use Nix with this book and
> take nix-darwin-kickstarter as a start point to build your own Nix configuration.
