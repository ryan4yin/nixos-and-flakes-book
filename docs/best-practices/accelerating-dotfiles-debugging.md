# Accelerating Dotfiles Debugging

When managing our Dotfiles with Home Manager, a common challenge arises â€“ each
modification to our Dotfiles requires executing `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`(or
`home-manager switch` if you use don't integrate home-manager into NixOS) to take effect.
However, running this command recalculates the entire system state each time, even though
Nix internally employs various caching mechanisms to expedite the process, it can still be
cumbersome.

Take my Neovim/Emacs configurations as an example; I frequently make high-frequency
modifications to them, sometimes dozens or hundreds of times a day. If each modification
necessitates waiting for `nixos-rebuild` to run for several seconds, it becomes a
significant time drain.

Fortunately, with the solution outlined in
[Simplifying NixOS Commands using Justfile](./simplify-nixos-related-commands.md), we can
expedite testing and verification of frequently modified Dotfiles by adding specific
configurations to the `Justfile`.

For instance, I've added the following content to my Justfile:

> The latest Justfile I'm using:
> [ryan4yin/nix-config/Justfile](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/blob/main/Justfile)

```Makefile
###############################################################
# Quick Test - Neovim
###############################################################


nvim-clean:
  rm -rf ${HOME}.config/astronvim/lua/user

nvim-test: nvim-clean
  rsync -avz --copy-links --chmod=D2755,F744 home/base/desktop/editors/neovim/astronvim_user/ ${HOME}/.config/astronvim/lua/user
```

Now, when I need to quickly test my Neovim configuration after making changes, I simply
run `just nvim-test`. Once testing is complete, I execute `just nvim-clean`, followed by
redeploying the configuration using `nixos-rebuild`. This allows for swift testing and
seamless restoration of the configuration.

This method is effective under the condition that your Dotfiles content is not generated
by Nix. For instance, my Emacs/Neovim configurations are native and are linked to the
appropriate locations solely through Nix Home-Manager's `home.file` or `xdg.configFile`.
